# v0.11 Migration Guide


**tldr;**

v0.11 comes with many minor improvements, as well as some internal cleanup in core.  The biggest change is that Sails core is now using Socket.io v1.

Almost none of this should affect the existing code in project, but there are a few important differences and new features to be aware of.  We've listed them below.


## Differences

#### The "firehose"

The "firehose" feature for testing with sockets has been deprecated.  If you don't know what that means, you have nothing to worry about. The basic usage will continue to work for a while, but it will soon be removed from core and should not be relied upon in your app.  This also applies to the following methods:
  + sails.sockets.subscribeToFirehose()
  + sails.sockets.unsubscribeFromFirehose()
  + sails.sockets.drink()
  + sails.sockets.spit()
  + sails.sockets.squirt()

> If you want the "firehose" back, let [Mike know on twitter](http://twitter.com/mikermcneil) (it can be brought back as a separate hook). But... yeah.


#### Upgrade the Socket.io / Sails.io browser client

Old v0.9 socket.io client will no longer work, so consequently you'll need to upgrade your sails.io.js client from v0.9 or v0.10 to v0.11.

To do this, just remove your sails.io.js client and install the new one.  We've bundled a helper generator that will do this for you, assuming your sails.io.js client is in the conventional location at `assets/js/dependencies/sails.io.js` (i.e. if you haven't moved or renamed it):

```sh
sails generate sails.io.js --force
```



## New features

Sails v0.11 also comes with some new stuff that we thought you'd like to know about:


#### User-level hooks

Hooks can now be installed directly from NPM.

This means you can now install hooks with a single command in your terminal.  For instance, consider the [`autoreload` hook]() by @sgress454, which watches for changes to your backend code so you don't need to kill and re-lift the server every time you change your controllers, routes, models, etc.

To install the `autoreload` hook, run:

```sh
npm install sails-hook-autoreload
```

This is just one example of what's possible.  As you might already know, hooks are the lowest-level pluggable abstraction in Sails.  They allow authors to tap into the lift process, listen for events, inject custom "shadow" routes, and, in general, take advantage of raw access to the `sails` runtime.
Most of the features you're familiar with in Sails have actually already been implemented as "core" hooks for over a year, including:

+ `blueprints` _(which provides the blueprint API)_
+ `sockets`    _(which provides socket.io integration)_
+ `grunt`      _(which provides Grunt integration)_
+ `orm`        _(which provides integration with the Waterline ORM, and imports your projects adapters, models, etc.)_
+ `http`       _(which provides an HTTP server)_
+ and 16 others.

You can read more about how to write your own hooks in the new and improved "Extending Sails" documentation on http://sailsjs.org.


#### Socket.io v1.x

The upgrade to Socket.io v1.0 shouldn't actually affect your app-level code, provided you are using the layer of abstraction provided by Sails itself; everything from the `sails.sockets.*` wrapper methods and "up" (resourceful pubsub, blueprints)
If you are using underlying socket.io methods in your apps, or are just curious about what changed in Socket.io v1.0, be sure and check out the [complete Socket.io 1.0 migration guide](http://socket.io/docs/migrating-from-0-9/) from Guillermo and the socket.io team.

#### Ever-increasing modularity

As part of the upgrade to Socket.io v1.0, we pulled out the core `sockets` hook into a separate repository.  This allowed us to write some modular, hook-specific tests for the socket.io interpreter, which will make things easier to maintain, customize, and override.
This also allows the hook to grow at its own pace, and puts related issues in one place.

Consider this a test of the pros and cons of pulling other hooks out of the sails core repo over the next few months.  This will make Sails core lighter, faster, and more extensible, with fewer core dependencies, shorter "lift" time for most apps, and faster `npm install`s.


#### Testing, the "virtual" request interpreter, and the `sails.request()` method

In the process of pulling the `sockets` hook _out_ of core, the logic which interprets requests has been normalized and is now located _in_ Sails core.  As a result, the `sails.request()` method is much more powerful.

This method allows you to communicate directly with the request interpreter in Sails without lifting your server onto a port.  It's the same mechanism that Sails uses to map incoming messages from Socket.io to "virtual requests" that have the familiar `req` and `res` streams.

The primary use case for `sails.request()` is in writing faster-running unit and integration tests, but it's also handy for proxying to mounted apps (or "sub-apps").

For instance, here is an example (using mocha) of how you might test one of your app's routes:

```js
var assert = require('assert');
var Sails = require('sails').Sails;

before(function beforeRunningAnyTests (done){

  // Load the app (no need to "lift" to a port)
  sails.load({
    log: {
      level: 'warn'
    },
    hooks: {
      grunt: false
    }
  }, function whenAppIsReady(err){
    if (err) return done(err);

    // At this point, the `sails` global is exposed, although we
    // could have disabled it above with our config overrides to
    // `sails.load()`. In fact, you can actually use this technique
    // to set any configuration setting you like.
    return done();
  });
});

after(function afterTestsFinish (done) {
  sails.lower(done);
});

describe('GET /hotpockets', function (){

  it('should respond with a 200 status code', function (done){

    sails.request({
      method: 'get',
      url: '/hotpockets',
      params: {
        limit: 10,
        sort: 'price ASC'
      }
    }, function (err, clientRes, body) {
      if (err) return done(err);

      assert.equal(clientRes.statusCode, 200);
      return done();
    });

  });
});
```


## Questions?

As always, if you run into issues upgrading, or if any of the notes above don't make sense, let me know and I'll do what I can to clarify.

Finally, to those of you that have contributed to the project since the v0.10 release in August: I can't stress enough how much I value your continued support and encouragement.  There is a pretty massive stream of issues, pull requests, documentation tweaks, and questions, but it always helps to know that we're in this together :)

Thanks.
